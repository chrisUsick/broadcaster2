= create Abstraction for `peer` object  in BroadcastApp
    PeerHandler is the abstaction class; it needs the following methods
        - manage all connections. Allow doing things like broadcast message to all connections
        - either expose the actual peer object or create wrapper methods (I think expose it)

- test on mobile browser
- create chat interface
- capture video for thumbnail


= refactor ViewApp.getBroadcastList to use server info
 = make Broadcast send Broadcast.metaData to server
